# Workout List App - Coding Assignment

## Overview

Welcome! This assignment is designed to evaluate your Android development skills, including your ability to work with JSON data, build clean UI, implement user interactions, and write testable, maintainable code.

You'll build an Android app that reads a local JSON file and displays a list of workouts. Users should be able to edit workout details.
You'll have one week to complete this assignment. While we understand everyone works at their own pace, we recommend spending no more than 4–6 hours on it. We’re not looking for a fully polished or production-ready app.  So, focus on clean, understandable code and demonstrating your thought process.
